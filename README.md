## Known Issues
Because of [recent changes](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/os-x-10-11-el-capitan-the-ars-technica-review/8/)
to how root permissions work on macOS, some files cannot be deleted even using
`sudo`.

This does not usually to **rmds**; however, it does mean the find-and-delete
function’s exit status cannot be trusted — so the current implementation just
ignores it entirely.

Until I make a workaround, legitimate failures may occur silently. :-(
